{"name":"Divine-right","tagline":"An open source, procedurally generated RPG.","body":"# The idea\r\nThe idea behind Divine Right is that of an RPG in a completely dynamic world. There is no fixed plot, no fixed quests, no scripted sequences and no fixed world or map. The world is acted upon by a number of NPCs who all make their own decisions, and help shape the world. And the player character is in the midst of it all...\r\n\r\nThe main concept here is that, contrary to other RPGs in which the player character is the most important being on the planet, and the world revolves around him (and the plot waits for him) - NPCs are just as powerful as the player. The player has an underlying mission, but how he does it, and how NPCs will react to it is up to them.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a bandit leader takes up home in a town's mine, he has done so for a reason. The town mayor might offer the job to the Player character, or any number of NPCs. If the player character takes the job, there is no guarantee that the bandit will not be killed by someone else in the meanwhile, or die of sickness, or leave of his own volition. And if nobody takes up the mantle, the town's economy could suffer for it.\r\n# Done so far (Development branch)\r\n\r\n* World Generates procedurally [Version 1]\r\n* Local Map Generation based on a number of maplets [Version 1]\r\n* Local Map Generation based on maplets read from xml file [Version 1]\r\n* The underlying code for moving around and interacting with objects and object classes\r\n* Dungeon Generation\r\n* Enemy Generation including basic combat system and attributes\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n## Random World Generation\r\n### In progress\r\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1496891/1872400/bfbcbcbe-78a5-11e3-9ac0-dd5d6ecdf6c1.PNG)\r\n### Finished Map\r\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1496891/1872399/bf8d749a-78a5-11e3-8630-7baf363c71b4.PNG)\r\n\r\n## Local Map Generation\r\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1496891/1872372/3e7dae2e-78a5-11e3-82d5-0478c40cffb8.PNG)\r\n\r\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1496891/1882598/45a687d8-7978-11e3-8294-fc50ed364f6d.png)\r\n\r\n## Dungeon Generation\r\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1496891/2118613/b0601b7c-9113-11e3-8f05-9def2ff73fe3.png)\r\n\r\n## Combat\r\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1496891/2491320/dcb931ba-b1e6-11e3-91e6-ec6c68eff540.PNG)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
